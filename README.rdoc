= Virtual Developer Jobs
Carson Cole

This application is an online job site for contract developers working virtually/remotely, but can be modified for any type of job site.

==== Banner Job ====
Jobs that are shown in the banner are shown based on their rank, which can be processed on a daily basis. To boost a job to likely show in the banner, you must increase its rank attribute, which will self-decay based on a cron job (explained below).

== Requirements

=== Ruby
Ruby version > 1.9 is required due to using Rails 4.2.5.

=== Database
Configured by default to use Sqlite3, but can be changed in database.yml to use any database.


== Installation

- RAILS_ENV=production rake db:migrate

- RAILS_ENV=production rake assets:precompile

- Load cron.txt into Crontab to process Job ranks on a daily basis.

== Authentication

== Notifications

Application notifications sends through gmail.
